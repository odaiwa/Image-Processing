Title of the project:
In this project we have pictures of pages with different camera shot position and we should
to do wrapping for every page 


Install Packages
  Chose “Terminal”at the bottom of the PyCharm
  Type “pip install opencv-contrib-python”.Note: it might take a few minutes to install the package
  Type “pip install matplotlib “ (I used it just to see the new images for once then i didnt used it , which means that i used it just for checking results)

After that you can import:

1) import cv2
2) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt (for me just to check resukts while im working in code)

you should also import:

3) import sys
4) import numpy as np
5) import os

how to run the code:
  in terminal write:
                
            python Scanner.py Input_Img output1


  explain:
     Scanner.py       -> your code
     Input_Img -> input folder (scan folder)
     output1      -> the folder that we want to save the images inside
